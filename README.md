# LeNet-5-SVD
Final Project of Advanced Mathematics in Bandung Institute of Technology (2020).

Lecture : Egi Muhammad Idris Hidayat ST,M.Sc.,Ph.D.

I chose to implement SVD as preprocessing method on MNIST dataset and implemented LeNet-5 CNN architecture.
Based on experiment, the SVD
improves the performance of the model with the 10 number of
components and gives 99.03% accuracy. Also the compression
ratio with 2 number of components can reduce about 7.87
times of the file size.
